# Decisions

An architecture decision record (ADR) log. Each entry follows the same shape:
**Context → Options considered → Decision → Consequences → How to reverse it.**

## ADR-001: DataFusion for the analytical path only; hand-write the transactional fast path

`Status: Accepted`
`Date: 2026-09-07`

### Context

R4 demands broad SQL coverage — CTEs, window functions, subqueries, a cost
model. R5 explicitly prohibits routing point lookups through analytical
machinery. These two requirements pull in opposite directions.

### Options considered

- **(a)** Use DataFusion for everything.
- **(b)** Hand-write both execution paths.
- **(c)** Split: DataFusion for analytics, hand-written fast path for OLTP.

### Decision

Option **(c)**.

DataFusion delivers the breadth R4 requires at a fraction of the cost of
building it. But routing a primary-key point lookup through logical planning,
physical planning, and a `RecordBatch` pipeline would violate R5's explicit
prohibition.

Splitting also makes the guarantee **structural** rather than advisory: the
OLTP crate does not depend on the OLAP crate, so a point lookup cannot
accidentally acquire analytical overhead.

### Consequences

- Two execution paths must be kept semantically consistent.
- A conformance test asserting that both paths return identical results for
  overlapping queries is **required**, not optional.

### How to reverse it

Collapse into DataFusion by implementing the fast path as a custom physical
operator.

## ADR-002: Adopt the delete-vector / delete-and-insert MVCC model

`Status: Accepted`
`Date: 2026-09-07`

### Context

MVCC cost has to be paid somewhere. A key-ordered merge-on-read model pays it
on every scan, which directly penalizes the analytical workload.

### Options considered

- **(a)** Key-ordered merge-on-read (merge at scan time).
- **(b)** Delete-and-insert with per-segment delete vectors, re-derived from
  StarRocks primary-key tables (see finding 1 in [`RESEARCH.md`](./RESEARCH.md)).

### Decision

Option **(b)**. Reads become a UNION of rowsets with each segment's delete
vector subtracted by a single bitmap ANDNOT — no key comparison, no merge, no
sort at read time.

### Consequences

- Write amplification and publish-time cost, in exchange for zero read-side
  merge cost.
- Delete vectors must be **version-scoped** and **copy-on-write**, so that
  applying a delete clones the bitmap and bumps its version without disturbing
  existing readers.

### How to reverse it

Switch to key-ordered merge-on-read, at the cost of scan performance.

## ADR-003: Two-phase visibility with version-density gating

`Status: Accepted`
`Date: 2026-09-07`

### Context

If commit must wait for every storage node to acknowledge, commit latency is
bounded by the slowest node.

### Options considered

- **(a)** Fuse durability and visibility into a single commit step.
- **(b)** Separate commit (assigns a version, journals one record, durable but
  invisible) from publish (idempotent background fan-out that makes data
  readable), gated on version density.

### Decision

Option **(b)**. A transaction becomes visible only when its version is exactly
`visibleVersion + 1` for every partition it touched. `committedVersion` is
derived as `nextVersion - 1` and never stored.

### Consequences

- Readers compare only against a per-partition visible version.
- Recovery is a replay in version order.
- A committed-but-unpublished transaction is durable, and becomes visible
  after a crash.

### How to reverse it

Fuse publish into commit, accepting commit latency bounded by the slowest
replica.

## ADR-004: One MVCC version domain and one WAL shared by both storage formats

`Status: Accepted`
`Date: 2026-09-07`

### Context

The system has two storage formats. They can either share a version domain and
a log, or maintain their own.

### Options considered

- **(a)** One shared MVCC version domain and one shared WAL.
- **(b)** Per-format version domains and per-format WALs.

### Decision

Option **(a)**. This allows a single transaction to touch a row-format
partition and a column-format partition atomically, and it makes the R2 format
swap a single metadata record.

### Consequences

- The WAL becomes a shared bottleneck and must support **group commit**.

### How to reverse it

Move to per-format WALs plus a two-phase protocol between them. This is
explicitly more complex — which is precisely why it was not chosen.

## ADR-005: `sqlparser-rs` with the MySQL dialect

`Status: Accepted`
`Date: 2026-09-07`

### Context

The system needs a SQL front end and a client-facing dialect.

### Options considered

- **(a)** `sqlparser-rs` with the MySQL dialect.
- **(b)** A hand-written parser.

### Decision

Option **(a)**.

### Consequences

- The system is bound by `sqlparser-rs` dialect coverage.
- Unsupported syntax must fail with a **clear error** rather than be silently
  mis-parsed.

### How to reverse it

Write a hand-written parser.

## ADR-006: ZooKeeper reference source not provided; derive from specification and validate against a real ensemble

`Status: Accepted`
`Date: 2026-09-07`

### Context

The project brief specified a reference source at `examples/zookeeper`, but
only `examples/starrocks` was present. See
[`LIMITATIONS.md`](./LIMITATIONS.md).

### Options considered

- **(a)** Build against a mock ZooKeeper.
- **(b)** Skip the ZooKeeper backend entirely.
- **(c)** Implement against the documented ZooKeeper 3.9 protocol via
  `zookeeper-async`, and test against a real ensemble in Docker.

### Decision

Option **(c)** — because session expiry and ephemeral-node loss are exactly
the behaviours a mock gets wrong, and they are the behaviours the coordination
layer depends on for correctness.

### Consequences

- ZooKeeper tests require Docker and are gated behind a feature flag in CI.

### How to reverse it

None needed.

## ADR-007: Single binary with selectable roles rather than separate FE/BE binaries

`Status: Accepted`
`Date: 2026-09-07`

### Context

The frontend and backend are distinct roles, but forcing two binaries
complicates the single-node development experience and the demo.

### Options considered

- **(a)** One binary, `htapd`, with a selectable role (frontend, backend, or
  both).
- **(b)** Two separate binaries.

### Decision

Option **(a)**.

### Consequences

- Simpler demo and `docker-compose` setup.
- The module boundary must be **policed by crate dependencies**, so that
  splitting into separate processes remains possible.

### How to reverse it

Add two thin binary crates over the same libraries.
